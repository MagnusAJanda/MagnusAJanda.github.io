Web Portfolio - Magnus Janda

For this assignment, I have successfully optimized my site for a variety of browsers and devices. Not only that, but I am proud to say my website most definitely meets the accessibility standards at hand - as this was something I have been focusing on and prioritizing from the very conception of my site. The design of my website remains very faithful to the mockup, albeit with minor changes purely for accessibility purposes. I also tried to use some free jQuery plugins called jQuery Easing, jQuery Shuffle, and jQuery Smooth-Scroll to enhance the visual interactions of the web page (admittedly I did struggle implementing the examples that were provided with these plugins). I used the web font Font Awesome for my icons. I have the rights to use the fonts provided by the site, so there should be no problem with that whatsoever. In addition, every image included on my site is royalty free and/or open to the general public for usage amongst anything - no copyrighted materials can or will be found on my site.
